# Multi-stage Dockerfile for Claude Code Agent Monitor - a Node.js server with a React client.
# This setup optimizes the final image size by separating the build and runtime stages.
# The first stage installs only the production dependencies for the server, while the second stage builds the React client.
# The final stage combines the necessary files and dependencies to run the application in production.
# Compatibility: This setup is compatible with both Podman and Docker. Runnable on any platform that supports Node.js and Alpine Linux.

# ── Stage 1: Install server production deps ───────────────────────────
FROM node:22-alpine AS server-deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
# The root `postinstall` and `prepare` hooks (scripts/postinstall.js,
# scripts/prepare.js) both fire during `npm ci`, so both files must exist here
# or npm aborts with MODULE_NOT_FOUND before installing anything. Each
# self-skips when its guard condition isn't met (postinstall when client/ is
# absent, as it is in this stage; prepare when INIT_CWD != cwd, which it never
# is for a real npm ci), so copying just these two scripts keeps this
# deps-cache layer from busting on unrelated scripts/ edits. Do NOT use
# --ignore-scripts: that would also skip better-sqlite3's prebuild fetch and
# silently drop the native SQLite driver.
COPY scripts/postinstall.js scripts/prepare.js ./scripts/
RUN npm ci --omit=dev

# ── Stage 2: Build React client ───────────────────────────────────────
FROM node:22-alpine AS client-build
WORKDIR /app/client
COPY client/package.json client/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY client/ ./
# vite.config.ts stamps the UI version from the repo-root package.json (one level
# up from the client dir). Provide it here so the built client shows the real
# release version; the config falls back gracefully if it is ever absent.
COPY package.json /app/package.json
RUN npm run build

# ── Stage 3: Production runtime ───────────────────────────────────────
FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# In a container the app MUST bind all interfaces: the server binds loopback by
# default (GHSA-gr74-4xfh-6jw9), but a container's loopback is a separate
# namespace the published port cannot reach, so a loopback bind makes the port
# unreachable. Inside a container the trust boundary is the *host* port publish
# (keep it on 127.0.0.1 — see docker-compose.yml / INSTALL.md), not this bind.
