/**
 * @file types.ts
 * @description Defines TypeScript types and interfaces for the agent dashboard application, including data structures for sessions, agents, events, statistics, analytics, model pricing, cost breakdowns, WebSocket messages, and workflow-related data. These types provide a clear contract for the shape of data used throughout the application and facilitate type safety when interacting with the backend API and managing state within the frontend components.

 * **Path:** `/Users/davidnguyen/WebstormProjects/Claude-Code-Agent-Monitor/client/src/lib/types.ts`
 * **Purpose:** Shared wire-format types for REST + WebSocket messages — keep in sync with `server/` serializers and OpenAPI.
 *
 * ## Design constraints
 * - Local-first: no telemetry leaves the machine unless the user configures webhooks.
 * - Fail-safe hooks path on the server must never block Claude Code; UI mirrors that
 *   philosophy by degrading gracefully (empty states, stale badges, reconnect loops).
 * - Destructive flows stay behind explicit confirmation modals and server-side gates.
 * - Internationalization: user-visible strings belong in i18n JSON, not literals here.
 *
 * ## Remote data & SSH
 * Remote Data Sources let operators aggregate multiple machines. SSH entries describe
 * how to reach a peer dashboard; the global data scope (`dataScope.ts`) narrows every
 * scoped GET via `?sources=`. Health checks and import history surface in Settings.
 *
 * ## Observability
 * Prometheus scrapes `GET /api/metrics` (see `monitoring/`). Grafana ships four
 * provisioned boards (overview, sessions, tools, alerts). Native npm scripts and
 * Docker Compose profiles are documented in `monitoring/README.md`.

/**
 * ## Module overview
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for the shapes exchanged between the
 * dashboard's Express/SQLite backend (`server/`) and its React + Vite frontend
 * (`client/`). Every interface here mirrors either:
 *
 *  - a **SQLite row** (e.g. {@link Session}, {@link Agent}, {@link DashboardEvent},
 *    {@link AlertRule}, {@link WorkflowRun}), possibly with a few extra computed
 *    columns that only appear on certain queries; or
 *  - a **REST response body** (e.g. {@link Stats}, {@link Analytics},
 *    {@link CostResult}, {@link WorkflowData}, {@link TranscriptResult}); or
 *  - a **WebSocket push payload** (e.g. {@link WSMessage} and its `data` union
 *    members such as {@link ImportProgressMessage}, {@link RunStreamPayload},
 *    {@link CcConfigChangedPayload}).
 *
 * ### Data-flow context
 *
 * The dashboard is local-first and event-driven. Claude Code emits lifecycle
 * hooks → the Express server ingests them → rows are written to SQLite → the
 * server broadcasts a {@link WSMessage} over the dashboard WebSocket → the React
 * UI updates in real time. The same rows are also queryable over REST for the
 * initial page load and for pagination. The types below therefore appear on both
 * the "fetch on mount" path and the "live update" path, and must stay backward
 * compatible so older UI tabs keep working while a session streams.
 *
 * ### Conventions used throughout
 *
 *  - **Timestamps** are ISO-8601 strings (e.g. `"2026-03-19T14:03:22.114Z"`)
 *    unless a field name or its doc comment says otherwise. A handful of
 *    lifecycle payloads (`Run*Payload.at`, `WorkflowProgressEntry.startedAt`)
 *    use epoch milliseconds instead — those are called out explicitly.
 *  - **`null` vs `undefined`.** A `T | null` field is a real column that is
 *    currently empty (the row exists but the value is unknown/not-yet-set). An
 *    optional `field?: T` is a value that is only present on some responses
 *    (e.g. a joined/computed column, or a field a newer server version added).
 *    Both meanings can coexist as `field?: T | null`.
 *  - **Costs** are always USD. Pricing rate fields are USD per million tokens
 *    ("MTok"); computed `cost`/`*_cost` fields are absolute USD amounts.
 *  - **Token counts** are raw integer token totals, bucketed into
 *    input / output / cache-read / cache-write categories. Cache reads are
 *    billed cheaper than fresh input; cache writes are billed as a premium.
 *  - **`metadata` / `data` / `details` string fields** hold opaque JSON that has
 *    NOT been parsed — call `JSON.parse` before reading them. They may be `null`.
 *  - **Status enums** are persisted lifecycle values (see {@link SessionStatus},
 *    {@link AgentStatus}); the `Effective*` variants overlay a transient
 *    "waiting on human input" state used only for rendering, never persisted.
 *
 * ### REST endpoint → type index
 *
 * A quick map from the backend routes to the response type they return, so a
 * reader can jump from an API call to the shape they'll get back:
 *
 *  - `GET  /api/sessions`, `/api/sessions/:id` .......... {@link Session}(`[]`)
 *  - `GET  /api/agents` ................................. {@link Agent}`[]`
 *  - `GET  /api/events`, `/api/sessions/:id` (events) ... {@link DashboardEvent}`[]`
 *  - `GET  /api/stats` .................................. {@link Stats}
 *  - `GET  /api/analytics` ............................. {@link Analytics}
 *  - `GET/PUT /api/pricing` ............................ {@link ModelPricing}`[]`
 *  - `GET  /api/pricing/cost[/:sessionId]` ............. {@link CostResult}
 *  - `GET  /api/updates/status` ........................ {@link UpdateStatusPayload}
 *  - `GET/POST/PATCH /api/alerts/rules` ................ {@link AlertRule}(`[]`)
 *  - `GET  /api/alerts` ................................ {@link AlertEvent}`[]`
 *  - `GET  /api/webhooks/providers` .................... {@link WebhookProvider}`[]`
 *  - `GET/POST/PATCH /api/webhooks` ................... {@link WebhookTarget}(`[]`)
 *  - `GET  /api/webhooks/:id/deliveries` .............. {@link WebhookDelivery}`[]`
 *  - `POST /api/webhooks/:id/test` .................... {@link WebhookTestResult}
 *  - `GET  /api/sessions/:id/stats` ................... {@link SessionStats}
 *  - `GET  /api/sessions/:id/transcript` ............. {@link TranscriptResult}
 *  - `GET  /api/sessions/:id/transcripts` ............ {@link TranscriptListResult}
 *  - `GET  /api/workflows` ........................... {@link WorkflowData}
 *  - `GET  /api/workflows/session/:id` ............... {@link SessionDrillIn}
 *  - `GET  /api/workflows/runs[/:runId]` ............. {@link WorkflowRunsResponse} /
 *    {@link WorkflowRunDetail}
 *
 * ### WebSocket `type` → payload index
 *
 * Every {@link WSMessage} carries a `type` discriminant and a matching `data`
 * payload (see {@link WSMessage} for the enumerated union):
 *
 *  - `session_created` / `session_updated` ............ {@link Session}
 *  - `agent_created` / `agent_updated` ................ {@link Agent}
 *  - `new_event` ..................................... {@link DashboardEvent}
 *  - `import.progress` ............................... {@link ImportProgressMessage}

 * ### Where these types are consumed
 *
 * The API-layer helpers in `client/src/lib/` (the fetch wrappers and the
 * `useWebSocket`/`eventBus` plumbing) return and dispatch these shapes; the
 * page components under `client/src/pages/` (Dashboard, SessionDetail,
 * Analytics, Workflows, Settings) then bind them straight to cards, tables, and
 * charts. Because a live tab can receive a `*_updated` push at any moment, the
 * UI is written to merge partial row updates over whatever it already has, which
 * is why so many computed/joined fields below are optional rather than required.
 *
 * Keeping these types accurate is a non-negotiable contract: the server response
 * shapes and WebSocket message types are expected to stay stable and backward
 * compatible (see the project's change guidelines for API/DB/WebSocket areas).
