 * Projects view's per-project `cwds` derivation at ~707-712) — this is the
 * "extract, don't copy" half of the `DERIVED-DUAL-VIEW` durable cure
 * (technical-plan.md §5): `KanbanBoard.tsx` is refactored to call these two
 * functions instead of keeping its own inline logic. No path normalization
 * anywhere here — a
 * trailing-slash cwd is a different string from its non-slashed counterpart,
 * matching the exact-string-equality behavior of the inline join this
 * replaces (see `projectLookup.test.ts`'s frozen-reference regression case).
