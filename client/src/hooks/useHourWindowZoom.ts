/**
 * @file useHourWindowZoom.ts
 * @description Reusable "hour-window zoom" state/logic for a single
 * selected day, extracted out of `FocusCalendarView.tsx` so a second
 * consumer (`FocusPage.tsx`) can offer the exact same start+duration
 * windowing without a calendar grid attached. Given just a `selectedDate`,
 * manages the zoom size (`hourWindow`: 4/8/12/24 hours, `24` meaning the
 * full, unzoomed day) and the window's anchor:
 *  - `"live"` (default, today only) — follows `hourWindow` hours behind the
 *    real current time plus a fixed 2h look-ahead, re-anchoring to "now"
 *    every `ZOOM_REFRESH_MS` via a forced re-render.
 *  - `"custom"` — an explicit start time the caller picked via a
 *    quick-start preset. The only mode a non-today day can render in,
 *    regardless of the stored `windowAnchorMode` (see `effectiveAnchorMode`).
 *
 * `FocusCalendarView.tsx` and `FocusPage.tsx` both call this with their own
 * `selectedDate` and render `HourWindowZoomBar` with the result — see that
 * component for the presentational half of this split.
