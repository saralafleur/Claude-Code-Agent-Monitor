/**
 * @file ConcurrencyStatTile.tsx
 * @description The Concurrency stat tile shared by `FocusReportBody` (the
 * per-project modal and the cross-project Calendar board) and `FocusPage` —
 * extracted so the primary/secondary ratio swap below lives in exactly one
 * place instead of three call sites. Renders BOTH concurrency figures at
 * once: one as the tile's big value — with its own denominator total right
 * beneath it ("of X active time" / "of X open-session time", the total the
 * big ratio is actually a ratio OF) — and the other ratio as a second
 * sub-line ("Nx while active" / "Nx across open sessions"), with a small
 * swap button on the label row that inverts which is which. The tooltip
 * always describes whichever ratio is currently primary.
 *
 * The chosen primary ("active" — the default — or "open") persists in
 * `localStorage` under `agent-monitor-concurrency-primary` (same
 * per-browser convention as the sidebar collapse and update-dismissal
 * keys), so the preference survives a refresh. Storage reads/writes are
 * try/catch-guarded: with storage unavailable (private mode) the tile
 * still works, it just forgets the choice on reload.
 *
 * A `null`/absent ratio renders as "—" when primary and simply omits the
 * sub-line when secondary (e.g. a report from a server that predates
 * `active_concurrency_ratio`); the swap button stays either way, so the
 * preference can still be set for reports that do carry both.
