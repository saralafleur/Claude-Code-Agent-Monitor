/**
 * Focus-time report: reconstructs how long a session actually spent on each
 * declared focus state (item / detour / feature / bug) by replaying its
 * ordered `Focus` events into timestamped segments, then discounts each
 * segment's wall-clock span for stretches with no hook activity at all past
 * a configurable grace window — so a session sitting idle for hours doesn't
 * inflate its "time on item" figure.
 *
 * Two independent replays over the same `events` table:
 *   1. Focus segments — walk `Focus` rows only, tracking the declared item
 *      pointer plus a detour stack (mirrors the client's own `focusKind()`
 *      classification: top-of-stack wins, falls back to the base item).
 *   2. Activity gaps — walk EVERY event for the session (any hook, any
 *      agent). A gap between two consecutive events longer than the grace
 *      window only counts the grace window's worth as "active"; the rest is
 *      "idle". This deliberately does not replay the Waiting/Active status
 *      machine (which has real fleet-drain guards baked into hooks.js) —
 *      the event-gap proxy reaches the same practical answer (a still-working
 *      subagent keeps emitting events, so its time stays counted) without
 *      duplicating that guarded logic outside the code that owns it.
 *
 * Env knob: DASHBOARD_FOCUS_IDLE_GRACE_SECONDS — default 300 (5 min); <= 0
 * disables idle discounting entirely (100% of wall-clock counts as active).
 *
 * A segment also carries a `chunks` breakdown — its span sliced into fixed
 * CHUNK_MS (10 min) windows, each flagged `active` if any real event landed
 * inside it. This is deliberately a plainer fact than active_ms/idle_ms
 * above (no grace-window credit, just "did anything happen here") — it
 * exists so a calendar rendering can color a segment's actually-quiet
 * stretches differently from its actually-worked ones, which a single
 * wall_ms-sized block can't show on its own. A whole-session inferred
 * segment (see {@link inferredSegment}) is exactly the case this matters
 * most for: its span runs session-start to session-ended_at regardless of
 * how much of that was silence, so without chunks a long idle tail reads
 * indistinguishably from real work.
 *
 * Sessions with NO declared Focus history fall back to the background
 * classifier's verdict (focus_inferences, written by focus-inference.js) as
 * one whole-session segment flagged `inferred: true` — declared history is
 * ground truth and is never mixed with or overwritten by inference.
 *
 * A session with neither — no declared Focus events AND no usable item/detour
 * inference (never classified yet, or the classifier came back
 * 'unclassified') — still gets one whole-session segment, kind `NONE_KIND`
 * ("none"), rather than being dropped from the report (see
 * {@link noFocusSegment}). An 'unclassified' verdict that still carries a
 * plain-English `reason` (a low-confidence miss in a planned project, or the
 * one-sentence activity summary a plan-less project's session gets instead —
 * see focus-inference.js's `llmSummarize`) is NOT bare: its `NONE_KIND`
 * segment carries `inferred: true` and that `reason`, same as an item/detour
 * inference does, via {@link inferredSegment} — only a session with no
 * usable inference AT ALL (never classified, or 'unclassified' with nothing
 * to say) falls all the way through to the bare {@link noFocusSegment}.
 * This matters most for a session that's currently running: the background
 * classifier only classifies a session once it's ended or quiet for
 * QUIET_MS (focus-inference.js), so a live, undeclared session would
 * otherwise be invisible on the calendar/list until it goes quiet or ends.
 * `NONE_KIND` segments carry no real kind to attribute time to, so they're
 * excluded from `totals.by_kind`/the per-item rollup (see
 * {@link addToTotals}) but DO count toward the aggregate `totals.wall_ms`/
 * `active_ms`/`idle_ms` and the project's wall-clock/concurrency figures,
 * same as any other segment.
 *
 * The project-level report also separates EFFORT time (the sum across every
 * session — agent-labor invested, inflates when sessions run concurrently)
 * from WALL-CLOCK time (the union of each session's own span, via
 * {@link mergeIntervals} — the calendar time at least one session was
 * running), and additionally from ACTIVE WALL-CLOCK time
 * (`active_wall_clock_ms` — the union of every session's grace-credited
 * active intervals, the calendar time at least one session was actually
 * doing something, which an open-but-silent session does NOT extend). See
 * {@link buildProjectFocusReport} for the full rationale.

 * Builds a project-scoped focus-time report: per-session segments (as

 * (`item_number`), and project-wide totals by kind. `sessions` must already
 * be scoped to the project's mapped folders by the caller.
 *
 * Also distinguishes EFFORT time from WALL-CLOCK time, since this dashboard
 * exists to watch multiple sessions run concurrently: `totals.active_ms` is
 * the sum across every session (agent-labor invested — the same number a
 * timesheet would report for N people working in parallel), while
 * `wall_clock_ms` is the union of each session's own span (first segment
 * start to last segment end), merged via {@link mergeIntervals} — the
 * calendar time during which at least one session was running. Concurrency
 * is measured at the session level (not per-segment/per-item), matching
 * what's actually running in parallel. `concurrency_ratio` (effort ÷
 * wall-clock) turns "9h effort in a 3h window" into a legible "3x
 * parallelism" instead of looking like the numbers don't add up; it's
 * `null` when there's no wall-clock time to divide by.
 *
 * `wall_clock_ms` counts a session's whole span — including stretches where
 * every open session sat silent (user asleep, sessions left open) — so
 * `concurrency_ratio` answers "how parallel across the calendar time
 * sessions were OPEN", diluting toward 0 the longer sessions idle.
 * `active_wall_clock_ms` is the second denominator: the union of every
 * session's grace-credited ACTIVE intervals (the exact per-gap credit
 * `active_ms` sums — see {@link activeIntervals}), i.e. the calendar time at
 * least one session was actually doing something. `active_concurrency_ratio`
 * (effort ÷ active wall-clock) then reads "how parallel while work was
 * actually happening" — always >= 1 when non-null, since every active
 * millisecond in the numerator lies inside some interval of the denominator
 * and a union can only be smaller than the sum. Both ratios are reported;
 * they answer different questions and neither replaces the other.
 *
 * `windowStartMs`/`windowEndMs` (both optional, each independently) are
 * threaded straight through to {@link buildSessionFocusReport}, which clips
 * every session's segments to that window before any of the totals/rollup/
 * wall-clock math below runs. Without them (the unbounded per-project
 * route's case), a session contributes its full history, same as always.
 * With them (the explicitly time-windowed route), a session that merely
 * OVERLAPS the window — e.g. one still running from a prior day, or
 * spanning midnight into the window — only contributes the slice of its
 * active/idle time that actually falls inside `[windowStartMs, windowEndMs)`,
 * so picking "today" can no longer pull in yesterday's accumulated time for
 * a long-running session.
