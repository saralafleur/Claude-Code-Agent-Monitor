/**
 * @file Stakeholder-readable window summaries for the Focus report —
 * the synthesis layer behind `GET /api/focus-report/summary`
 * (server/routes/focus-report.js). Compresses a window's per-session focus
 * segments — labels, kinds, one-sentence inferred reasons, wall/active
 * time — into plain-language bullets a non-technical stakeholder can read
 * ("what did we actually do in this window").
 *
 * Two paths, split at DIRECT_WINDOW_MAX_DAYS local calendar days:
 *  - **Direct** (≤2 days): one LLM shot over the window's raw session facts,
 *    up to 4 bullets. When the window holds more than 40 sessions, the MOST
 *    RECENT are kept (earlier ones dropped with an explicit note) — never
 *    the reverse, which would silently cut the newest work.
 *  - **Hierarchical** (wider): summarize each local calendar day via the
 *    direct path (each day cached under its own scope-qualified key —
 *    permanently, once the day's data stops changing), then ONE rollup shot
 *    synthesizes the window from the per-day bullets, with a bullet budget
 *    that scales with the span (6 up to a week, 8 beyond — `bulletBudget`).
 *    This is what keeps a three-week summary concrete: day summaries stay
 *    specific, no session cap ever drops a whole day, and a day whose own
 *    synthesis fails degrades to its raw fact lines instead of vanishing.
 *    Repeat views of an unchanged window serve straight from cache with
 *    ZERO LLM calls (the pre-generation digest fast path).
 *
 * Reuses focus-inference.js's hermetic spawn contract verbatim via its
 * exported `runClaudePromptJson` (hooks disabled, all tools disallowed,
 * cwd = tmpdir, `DASHBOARD_FOCUS_INFER_TIMEOUT_MS` kill timer) — never
 * a second, slightly-different `claude -p` invocation path. The model is
 * `DASHBOARD_FOCUS_SUMMARY_MODEL` when set, falling back to the shared
 * `DASHBOARD_FOCUS_INFER_MODEL`, then `haiku` (see {@link summaryModel}).
 * Availability
 * follows the same gate as inference's LLM path: `DASHBOARD_FOCUS_INFER_MODE`
 * must be `llm` (the default) and the `claude` CLI must probe as runnable;
 * otherwise `generateWindowSummary` resolves null and the route reports the
 * summary as unavailable rather than erroring.
 *
 * Caching: one `focus_summaries` row per cache key (the route's normalized
 * scope+window request string). `computeInputDigest` hashes the summary-
 * relevant slice of the report (per-session segment kinds/labels/reasons/
 * times); a cached row is served only while its stored digest still matches,
 * so a finished day is generated exactly once and served forever, while a
 * still-running day regenerates whenever new activity actually changed the
 * input — not on every page view.
 *
 * Every cache resolution (hit or miss) at a "real" decision point — the
 * direct-path window request, each hierarchical per-day building block, and
 * the hierarchical window's own fast-path/rollup checks — is also persisted
 * to `focus_summary_access_log` via {@link recordAccess}, for the Settings →
 * Focus Summaries section's day timeline and per-day drill-down. This is
 * separate from `focus_summaries` itself, which only holds the CURRENT row
 * per cache key with no history. Logging never throws back into generation.
