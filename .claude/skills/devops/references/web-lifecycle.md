# web-build / web-up / web-down — the web-app dev stack

Aliases (bare, unqualified — reassigned away from the desktop commands):
`build` → `web-build`, `up` → `web-up`, `down` → `web-down`.

Goal: the fast iteration loop — Vite HMR reloads sub-second, versus roughly
a minute for a full `desktop-build` cycle. Use this for anything scoped to
`client/` or `server/`; reach for `desktop-build` only when you need to
verify Electron-specific behavior (tray, native menu, packaging) or want
the actual installed app updated.

Backend: a single native process — `node scripts/dev.js` (what `npm run
dev` runs: Express + Vite via `concurrently`). Not Docker — this app reads
live Claude Code hook events and session working directories from
`~/.claude/` on the host, and `better-sqlite3` is a native module built for
the host Node's ABI; containerizing would mean bind-mounting the same host
paths anyway, and on macOS Docker's bind-mount layer adds real latency to
Vite's file-watching. See `DESKTOP.md`-adjacent project discussion — this
is a deliberate choice, not an oversight.

`scripts/dev.js` already forwards `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` through to its
`concurrently` children (server + Vite), so `web-down` only needs to signal
the one tracked PID — no process-group gymnastics, no name-pattern `pkill`
that could collide with some other project's `vite`.

## Solution this covers

| Solution | Underlying unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `web` (only solution; `all` means the same thing) | `node scripts/dev.js`, tracked via PID file | Express (`server/index.js`) + Vite client, same process tree `npm run dev` starts |

State: PID file `~/.claude/.ccam-web-dev.pid`, log `~/.claude/.ccam-web-dev.log` (mirrors this project's own convention of keeping runtime state under `~/.claude/` — see `server/lib/server-info.js` / `~/.claude/.agent-dashboard.json`).

## Shared audit (Phase 1 for all three actions below)

```bash
zsh <skill-base-dir>/scripts/web-check.sh
```

Reports: dependencies installed, whether `client/dist` (the production
bundle) exists, and whether the dev server is currently running (PID, the
Vite frontend port, and the Express API port). Read-only, exits 0 always.
If invoked in status-only mode (bare `/devops`), stop after showing the
table.

If `root-deps` / `client-deps` are missing, point Sara at `/devops
web-setup` first.

## build (alias: `build`)

**Plan:** rebuilds `client/dist`, the production bundle (`npm run build`).
Not required for `web-up` — Vite dev mode serves from source — but is what
`npm start` and the desktop app ship, so this is useful as a fast
production-parity check without going all the way to a desktop rebuild.
Non-destructive; no gate needed.

**Execute:**
```bash
cd <project-root>
npm run build
```

**Verify:** re-run the shared audit — `client-build` reads `ok`. Confirm
`client/dist/index.html` exists.

## up (alias: `up`)

**Plan:** state that this starts two processes — Express (API + WebSocket,
auto-picking a free port starting at 4820 if something else, commonly the
desktop app, already holds it) and Vite (the actual HMR frontend, its own
free port starting at 5173) — in the background. Non-destructive, nothing
to confirm — starting a local dev server has no side effect beyond binding
two ports.

**The frontend URL is Vite's port (5173 by default), not 4820.** In
development mode `server/index.js` registers no static/catch-all frontend
routes at all — see `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s Development diagram and the
Deployment Modes table in `README.md` (`Client URL: http://localhost:5173`
for dev, `:4820` only for prod). Port 4820 in dev mode serves `/api/*` and
`/ws` only; Vite's dev server is what actually serves the page and proxies
`/api` + `/ws` back to 4820. Opening `http://localhost:4820/` directly in
dev mode is expected to 404 ("Cannot GET /") — that is not a bug, don't
try to "fix" it by pointing the user there.

If the audit already shows `web-running`, report that it's already up
(with its PID and the full frontend URL, e.g. `http://localhost:5173`,
labeled **(hot-reload)**) and stop — idempotent, no second instance
started.

**Execute:**
```bash
cd <project-root>
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude"
nohup node scripts/dev.js > "$HOME/.claude/.ccam-web-dev.log" 2>&1 &
echo $! > "$HOME/.claude/.ccam-web-dev.pid"
disown
```

Invoking `node scripts/dev.js` directly (rather than `npm run dev`) avoids
an extra process layer between the tracked PID and the process that
actually has the `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` forwarding logic — `web-down` signals
exactly the process that knows how to shut down its own children cleanly.
`scripts/dev.js` forces `NODE_ENV=development` on the children it spawns
(unless the caller already set it) — without that, `server/index.js`
silently defaults to `NODE_ENV=production` and serves the stale prebuilt
`client/dist` bundle instead of proxying to Vite, which masks any source
change until the next `web-build`.

**Verify:** re-run the shared audit — `web-running` shows a PID and both
the Express and Vite ports. Then prove each is actually serving:

```bash
sleep 2
PORT="$(grep -oE 'listen on :[0-9]+|using [0-9]+ instead' "$HOME/.claude/.ccam-web-dev.log" | tail -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+')"
VITE_PORT="$(grep -oE 'Local:\s+http://localhost:[0-9]+' "$HOME/.claude/.ccam-web-dev.log" | tail -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+')"
curl -sf "http://localhost:${PORT:-4820}/api/health"
curl -sf "http://localhost:${VITE_PORT:-5173}/" > /dev/null
```

Report the full **frontend** URL plainly in the reply — `http://localhost:${VITE_PORT:-5173}` —
don't just say "it's up," give the clickable address, and label it
**(hot-reload)** so it's never confused with the Docker production build's
URL (`docker-up` reports its own URL labeled **(built-docker)** — see
`docker-lifecycle.md`). Mention the Express port too (for API/WS
debugging) but don't hand it to Sara as "the site". Neither port may be
the default if something else (e.g. the desktop app on 4820, or another
Vite instance on 5173) already holds it; `scripts/dev.js` logs a warning
about shared-database double-counting in that case, surface it if present.

## down (alias: `down`)

**Plan:** stop the tracked process. Cheaply reversible — `up` starts a
fresh one from the same source in a couple seconds. No confirmation gate
needed (unlike `desktop-remove`, this touches no installed app, no user
data — it's just stopping a local process).

If the audit shows `web-running` as "not running", report there's nothing
to stop and stop here.

**Execute:**
```bash
PID_FILE="$HOME/.claude/.ccam-web-dev.pid"
PID="$(cat "$PID_FILE" 2>/dev/null)"
if [ -n "$PID" ] && kill -0 "$PID" 2>/dev/null; then
  kill -TERM "$PID"
  for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    kill -0 "$PID" 2>/dev/null || break
    sleep 1
  done
  kill -0 "$PID" 2>/dev/null && kill -KILL "$PID"
fi
rm -f "$PID_FILE"
```

`SIGTERM` is enough in the normal case — `scripts/dev.js` forwards it to
`concurrently`, which forwards it to the server and Vite, both exiting
cleanly. The `SIGKILL` fallback only fires if something hangs past 5s.

**Verify:** re-run the shared audit — `web-running` reads "not running".
Confirm the port is free: `lsof -nP -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN` returns
nothing for the port `up` was using (skip if it was never captured).

## Notes

- No `web-remove` — there's no destructive artifact to wipe. `client/dist`
  is just a build output `web-build` regenerates every run; deleting it
  manually (`rm -rf client/dist`) is enough on the rare occasion you'd want
  to, and doesn't warrant a gated command of its own.
- If the desktop app is also running, it's on the same port (4820) unless
  displaced — `web-up` detects this via `scripts/dev.js`'s own port-probe
  and picks a fallback port automatically. Both processes share the same
  SQLite database (`~/.claude/agent-dashboard`), so live hook events get
  counted by both if left running together; `scripts/dev.js` already warns
  about this in its log output when it happens.
